we created an API endpoint to persist the incoming request.Now, in this lesson we'll be adding an endpoint that allows users to update their tasks.And another endpoint to mark the task as complete.All right.Let's switch over to our editor.Then let's first open the update task request.Since we need the same validation rules as the store task request.Let's remove everything inside the class.Then extend the class.From the store task request.Let's getrillionid of the form request namespace and port from here.Okay, let's switch back over to the task controller.Here.We don't need the edit method for our API.Just get rid of that.And in the update method.Let's update the task by calling the task instance.Then call the update method.And then pass in the incoming request that has been validated.Once updated, we'll return it as a JSON response.So let's copy the code from here, then paste it here.And then remove the redirect response.Let's give this a save.Back to Postman.Duplicate this request.Rename it to updating a task.For the http verb, we'll need a put method.In the URL, we need to specify the resource that will be updating.In my case, 11.Next.Let's go to the body section.And for now, let's remove the name to see if the validation is working as expected.And indeed, it's working.Let me put back the name and I'll update the task name to task one.Updated.Let's hit the send button again.Okay.The task has been updated successfully.Next, let's add another endpoint that allows users to mark the task as complete.Let's open up our terminal.Then create a new controller using the artisan make controller command.Let's hit.Enter.The controller name will be API.Version one.Complete task controller.Hit enter again.And here, let's make it an invokable controller.So I'll enter to.Let's open up the controller we just created.Inside the method.Let's type int the task model in the second argument.Import its namespace.Then remove the response.Return type.Then inside here, let's update these completed attribute.With the is completed.That comes from the request.Then to persist the change.Let's call the save method.Once it is updated, we'll return the task resource.Let's import the namespace.And then pass the task instance in.Last.Let's open up the API file.And then define a new route for our newly created controller.It's going to be patch.The root path is going to be tasks.It receives an argument task.Then we'll be suffixing it with complete.And the controller will be the complete task controller.Okay, Let's give it a save.Back to Postman.Save the request.Change.Then duplicate this request.Let's rename it to Mark.A task is complete.Here are the http variable will be patch.The URL will be localhost 8000.API.Version one tasks.Task ID and then complete.Then in the body section.Let's send is completed with a boolean value.For now, let's give it true.Now I'll hit the send button.Here the is completed is true.If I now change the value to false.Then hit the send button again.The is completed now changes to false.
